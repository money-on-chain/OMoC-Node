###2) Staking (Allow->Deposit)
To be able to subscribe your Oracle to coin pairs and participate in the rounds, you need to deposit a minimum amount of stake in the system.
In order to do that, first you will need to have tokens or get them from the MoC foundation. Then go to the Staking page -> Deposit tab and allow the system to access your MoCToken. After that you can make the Deposit of the tokens.
